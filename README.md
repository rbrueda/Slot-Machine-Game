# Slot-Savory

An interactive cross-platform, slot-machine game built using Python. The game's objective is to retrieve as much money as you can get, making sure the amount of money is not negative. This project was mostly built on Python's built-in interface, Tkinter, to create a Graphical User Interface. In addition, I used Python's module "threading" to create Thread-based parallelism that asynchronously loops through music without interrupting the user-interface's tasks. Lastly, I used play_sounds, a cross platform API, which can asynchronously play music. This helped improve the speed of achieving option results when the "spin" button is clicked, while still successively playing win/lose sounds.

The main features of this game are: 
1.  Eleven different options that contain a number of points (smaller amount of points = less likelihood)
2. "Spin" button that generates three images on the screen (images representing options)
3. Depending on the options executed on the screen, the user may gain, lose, or receive no money
4. The "Claim your money" button is displayed when the user decides to end the game and retrieve their money
5. If money is less than or equal to 0, the game ends and displays "GAME OVER" on the screen
